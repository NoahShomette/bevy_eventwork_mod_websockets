# `BEMW Wasm Client Example`

This client is a wasm build version of the BEMW client example. It runs in your browser and proves that BEMW and Eventwork are able to communicate between browser and native apps. You can build and run it like any other Bevy WASM app.

I use [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/) for testing. See the [Bevy Cheatbook WASM guide](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/platforms/wasm.html) for more information on running Bevy in the browser.
